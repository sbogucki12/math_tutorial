# Graphs

![Intro to Graphs](graphs-intro.png)

Going to learn about points, domain, and range. 

What does f(0) really mean? What is the output of the function, given your input is 0. So: ( 0, )

So, f(x)=0 is asking, what values can x be that outputs (y axis) of 0? So: ( , 0).    If you have a graph, find all the x-intercepts, where the y-axis is 0.  

f(x) > 0 is asking for what interval, is your x-axis positive? an answer could be something like -4 < x < 6.  In interval notation, that's (-4, 6). Parantheses instead of brackets because you starting from near 4, not AT 4 and going to near 6, not TO 6.  (Because the question asked f(x) > 0, not f(x) >= 0)

**Domain** is the entire section of the x-axis that our graph covers. Could be something like {x | -6 <= x <= 11}. Notice that we are using brackets and equals, because we want to include -6 and 11. [ -6, 11 ]

**Range** is the section of the y-axis covered by the graph. So, something like {y | -3 <= y <= 6}. [-3, 6]

**x-intercepts** are the points on the graph that intercept the x axis with a y=0. 

**y-intecept** is the one point where the y-axis crosses x=0. (if it exists) 

### Solving without Graphs

f(x) = $\frac{x+2}{x-6}$ 

f(x) = 2?

2 = $\frac{x+2}{x-6}$ 

Solve 

x = 14.  so (14, 2)

**How to find x intercept.**  Remember x intercept means x = 0. f(x) = 0 

0 = $\frac{x+2}{x-6}$

Solve. Really easy because the denominator x 0 = 0.  So, it becomes 0 = x + 2.  x = -2.  (-2, 0)

**How to find y intercept.** Remember, y intercept means that x = 0.  So f(0) = $\frac{x+2}{x-6}$ 

Solve

f(0) = $\frac{0+2}{0-6}$ 

(0, - $\frac{1}{3}$ )
