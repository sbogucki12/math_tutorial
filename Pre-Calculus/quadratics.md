## Square Root Method

1. Set quadratic = 0
2. Isolate the x $^2$
3. Take the square root of both sides
*Don't forget to add +/- with your square root (because, remember, you're looking for the x-intercepts of a parabola, so you typically will get two solutions)*

Square root method only works if you can isolate all the x's with a $^2$ 

ON your graph, if you get two different solutions with real numbers, the parabola will go through x and have two x-intercepts.
If you get two solutions that are the same real numbers, the parabola will touch at the x-intercept, but not go through the x axis
If you get two solutions that have imaginary numbers, your parabola will not go through x axis. 

You get imaginary numbers when you try to get the square root of a negative number

**Note:** *The solution in the bottom right function has an error, the two in the denominator should be three*


## Factoring

1. set quadratic = 0
2. make sure the term are in order
3. make sure first term is positive
4. Distribute
5. Factor out the GCF, if there is one
6. Factor by grouping.
   1. Find two terms that add up to the second term and multiple to the first term times the third term
   2. Rewrite the quadratic with the second term split into the two terms identified in the previous step
   3. Factor out the two groups in the new quadratic 

 If you can factor, you will always get x-intercepts (no imaginary numbers)
