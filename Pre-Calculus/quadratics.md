## Square Root Method

1. Set quadratic = 0
2. Isolate the x $^2$
3. Take the square root of both sides
*Don't forget to add +/- with your square root (because, remember, you're looking for the x-intercepts of a parabola, so you typically will get two solutions)*

Square root method only works if you can isolate all the x's with a $^2$ 

ON your graph, if you get two different solutions with real numbers, the parabola will go through x and have two x-intercepts.
If you get two solutions that are the same real numbers, the parabola will touch at the x-intercept, but not go through the x axis
If you get two solutions that have imaginary numbers, your parabola will not go through x axis. 

You get imaginary numbers when you try to get the square root of a negative number

**Note:** *The solution in the bottom right function has an error, the two in the denominator should be three*


## Factoring

1. set quadratic = 0
2. make sure the term are in order
3. make sure first term is positive
4. Distribute
5. Factor out the GCF, if there is one
6. Factor by grouping.
   1. Find two terms that add up to the second term and multiple to the first term times the third term
   2. Rewrite the quadratic with the second term split into the two terms identified in the previous step
   3. Factor out the two groups in the new quadratic 

 If you can factor, you will always get x-intercepts (no imaginary numbers)

## Completing the Square

Imagine you have: x $^2$ -6x = 0 or an equation that won't factor easily. 

You want to factor but you don't have a third term or you do, but it won't factor.  

**Find two same numbers that add to the second term, multiply them and add the out come as the third term to the equation**

But, remember, if you are adding a term to the equation, you must cancel it out somehow. 

If you have an equation that has three terms but won't factor, temporarily disregard the third term and use the first two terms to do the step bolded above. 

When you add the new third term into the equation, after you factor the squares, you need to subtract the added term. 

so: 

0 = x $^2$ + 4x - 3

0 = x $^2$ + 4x +4 -4 -3 

(x+2)(x+2) - 7 = 0

(x+2) $^2$ -7 = 0 

(x+2) $^2$  = 7 

$\sqrt{(x+2)^2}$ = +- $\sqrt{7}$

x = -2 + $\sqrt{7}$ and x = -2 - $\sqrt{7}$

**Note:** *This works if the coeeficient on the a term is 1.*

If you can factor out from the first two terms to make the coefficient in the first term 1.  See the example in the top right: 

![Completing the Square](comp-square.png)

In the example above, though you added 1 to the equation, you actually have to cancel it by minusing 5 (because you have to distribute the 5 that is outside of the parentheses). So: 

5(x $^2$ - 2x +1) - 5 + 2 = 0

**Note:** *How to divide a fraction in half?  Divide the numerator by two or nultiply the denominator by two*
