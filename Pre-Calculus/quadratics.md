## Square Root Method

1. Set function = 0
2. Isolate the x $^2$
3. Take the square root of both sides
*Don't forget to add +/- with your square root (because, remember, you're looking for the x-intercepts of a parabola, so you typically will get two solutions)*

ON your graph, if you get two different solutions with real numbers, the parabola will go through x and have two x-intercepts.
If you get two solutions that are the same real numbers, the parabola will touch at the x-intercept, but not go through the x axis
If you get two solutions that have imaginary numbers, your parabola will not go through x axis. 

You get imaginary numbers when you try to get the square root of a negative number

**Note:** *The solution in the bottom right function has an error, the two in the denominator should be three*
