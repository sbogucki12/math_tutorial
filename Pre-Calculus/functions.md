# Functions

Takes one input and maps it mathematically to one output

Input is usually x
Output is usually y or f(x)

An input never gives more than one output

Input is the independent variable 
Output (y or f(x)) is the dependent variable 

(x, y) or (x, f(x)) = ordered pairs for graphing

domain = set of inputs
range = set of outputs

In the domain, every input has to be unique (or else, the input would have multiple outputs, which is not allowed)

To determine if algebraic expressions are functions, arrange them so that you are solving for y.  
if y only produces one output, it is a function

So, for example y = $\pm$ $\sqrt{3 - 2x}$ would not be a function because the $\pm$ creates two possible outputs for y

Every time you need to take a square root to solve an expression for y, you are going to need $\pm$ so every time you need to take a square root, it is not a function

## Composition

Evaluating a function requires replacing the independent variable with something else. 

### Domain problems: 

Input that evaluate to negative numbers inside a square root are a problem

Remember, you can't divide by zero, so input that results in $\dfrac{5}{0}$ or denominator of zero is a problem. Dividing by zero results in undefined. 

### Difference Quotient

$\dfrac{f(x=h)-f(x)}{h}$ results in slope because you are dividing the difference in output values (y values, "rise") and dividing by the change (x value, "run")
