# Functions

Takes one input and maps it mathematically to one output

Input is usually x
Output is usually y or f(x)

An input never gives more than one output

Input is the independent variable 
Output (y or f(x)) is the dependent variable 

(x, y) or (x, f(x)) = ordered pairs for graphing

domain = set of inputs
range = set of outputs

In the domain, every input has to be unique (or else, the input would have multiple outputs, which is not allowed)

To determine if algebraic expressions are functions, arrange them so that you are solving for y.  
if y only produces one output, it is a function

So, for example y = $\pm$ $\sqrt{3 - 2x}$ would not be a function because the $\pm$ creates two possible outputs for y

Every time you need to take a square root to solve an expression for y, you are going to need $\pm$ so every time you need to take a square root, it is not a function
