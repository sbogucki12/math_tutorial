## Introduction

Welcome to my repository! Here, you will find my detailed notes and solutions to the challenge problems associated with the material covered in the Professor Leonard videos. These videos cover a wide range of topics in mathematics, including calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations.

## Timeline


### [Day 9](https://github.com/sbogucki12/math_tutorial/blob/main/Pre-Calculus/graphs.md#graph-transformations) Jan. 21, 2024 
- Watched video on [Transforming Graphs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTCRB6hMsC4&list=PLDesaqWTN6ESsmwELdrzhcGiRhk5DjwLP&index=14)
  - Vertical and horizontal shifts, stretching, compressing and reflecting. 
  - I think I forgot to log it, but during one these past days, I watched the video on the essential functions and memorized the graph of some key functions, which is important for being able to shift them easilly.  


### [Day 8](/Pre-Calculus/graphs.md) Jan. 14, 2024 
- Watched video on [Piecewise Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHZKgl_9o7M&list=PLDesaqWTN6ESsmwELdrzhcGiRhk5DjwLP&index=12)
- Watched video on [Average Rate of Change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5Y-ONkezDM&list=PLDesaqWTN6ESsmwELdrzhcGiRhk5DjwLP&index=11)

### [Day 7](/Pre-Calculus/graphs.md) Jan. 9, 2024 
- Watched video on [Properties of Functions - Extrema (Local and Absolute Max & Min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hItEGb3KJo&list=PLDesaqWTN6ESsmwELdrzhcGiRhk5DjwLP&index=10)

### [Day 4](/Pre-Calculus/functions.md) Dec. 30, 2023
- Watched video on Operations of Functions
- Practiced retaining domain issues, then executing operations on the functions 

### [Day 3](/Pre-Calculus/functions.md) Dec. 28, 2023
- Watched video on Domain problems
- Practiced how to determine Domain when there are square roots and fractions with variables in the denominator 

### [Day 2](/Pre-Calculus/functions.md) Dec. 27, 2023
- Watched video on Domain Problems and the brief intro to Difference Quotient
- Practiced evaluating functions (with physical pen and paper)
  
### [Day 1](/Pre-Calculus/functions.md) Dec. 26, 2023 
- Watched video on [Introduction to Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 2)](https://youtu.be/FkUEsP9efFg?si=-CqrPY1XuoAFuWqZ)
