- Watched video on [Factoring to Solve Quadratics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2CFHYJWS60&list=PLDesaqWTN6ESsmwELdrzhcGiRhk5DjwLP&index=18)
  - Paused video and actually solved all of the examples. &#x2705;

- Watched video on [Square Root Method in Solving Quadratics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXAd6rkNSK0&list=PLDesaqWTN6ESsmwELdrzhcGiRhk5DjwLP&index=17&t=13s)


### [Day 10](https://github.com/sbogucki12/math_tutorial/blob/main/Pre-Calculus/graphs.md#graph-transformations) Jan. 23, 2024 
- Watched video on [Graphing Transformations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkrMJLSpJFI&list=PLDesaqWTN6ESsmwELdrzhcGiRhk5DjwLP&index=15)
  - Actually paused the video and worked through all of the transformations.  This actually all makes sense to me and I was able to work them out correctly. 
 


### [Day 9](https://github.com/sbogucki12/math_tutorial/blob/main/Pre-Calculus/graphs.md#graph-transformations) Jan. 21, 2024 
- Watched video on [Transforming Graphs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTCRB6hMsC4&list=PLDesaqWTN6ESsmwELdrzhcGiRhk5DjwLP&index=14)
  - Vertical and horizontal shifts, stretching, compressing and reflecting. 
  - I think I forgot to log it, but during one these past days, I watched the video on the essential functions and memorized the graph of some key functions, which is important for being able to shift them easilly.  


### [Day 8](/Pre-Calculus/graphs.md) Jan. 14, 2024
